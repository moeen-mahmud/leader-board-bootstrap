## My Process

### Built With

- HTML5 markup
- Custom CSS
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the follow up project of previouse [Leader Board Challenge](https://exercise-leader-board.vercel.app/). It's just the bootstrap version. I follow the [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/) for building this page.

### Continued Development

By doing this project, I came to realize that, raw css is far better than bootstrap as always.
